**Overview

Using current weather data provided by OpenWeather API, implement a mood based playlist or genre selection from the Last.FM API that matches the current weather.

**Goals

Implement and correctly pull weather API information, display on the page, and sort against Last.FM music data and team created playlist algorithm.

Playlist will be saved to the page and refreshed dynamically. We will need to randomize the playlist each time so that if the weather remains unchanged, the playlist continues to change, appropriate to the current conditions.

Bonus features to be added pending completion of core functional requirements.

Incorporate Firebase User Authentication as a our new technology.

**Specifications

Using the weather conditions provided by OpenWeather, and team-defined genres and songs, a playlist must be dynamically created, and displayed on the home page utilizing the Last.FM API.

The selected playlist will need to be presented on the page, and if all functional requirements can be met, then we will also be adding in a “Liked” ability for each song that will be saved to the database.  Regardless of Likes, all dynamically created playlist entries will be saved to the database for future reference.

We will be utilizing Materialize, Moment, Firebase + Firebase User Authentication, jQuery, and Javascript to achieve these results.  We are also experimenting with Postman on a separate tangent to learn how to optimize our development time for future projects.
